===============

RESTfull app intended as backend for make-your-offer application (<https://github.com/twyszomirski/make-your-offer.git>). 
Based on Jersey + CDI support.


### Build

mvn clean install

### Deploy

Deploy on any application server with support for CDI and JAX-RS. That's in theory, tested with Glassfish 4. 

### Planned

* Make CDI testable more easily with mockito
* Make app deploayable on servlet container
